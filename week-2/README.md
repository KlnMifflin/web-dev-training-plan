Learning Reflections:

I really enjoyed working with React, and I wish I'd started sooner. Making edits in code and seeing real-time changes was very rewarding. Learning to use routing to link between pages and states to retain and alter information across pages was interesting and fun.

I ran into a few challenges over the course of this project. Ensuring unique links while permitting editing and deleting of elements led me to learn about UUIDv4 and how to use it to ensure unique keys and links. Editing and deleting lists and/or their elements from the state proved slightly more difficult than expected. This expanded my knowledge of JavaScript functions, as I used find and filter to update the state correctly, and props to pass it across pages.

This project taught me a lot about how to use React to develop an application. I learned to use routing and links to travel between pages while allowing them to share data. I learned how to use states to retain information, setting and updating them as necessary and passing them between components through props. I learned about components themselves and how to include them within React HTML-like markup as custom elements. I also expanded on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript capabilities.
