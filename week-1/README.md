Learning Reflections:

I very much enjoyed this project. It was fun to develop my own personal website, even if I was not quite sure where to start. I really liked exploring the different ways in which elements can be styled, and successfully creating a dark mode toggle was very encouraging.

I encountered multiple challenges as well. CSS reveals an abundance of styling choices. However, it can also be very unintuitive (as I was warned while learning how to use it). The formatting of some components, such as the "What I Have Done" section, was a great challenge to design. Creating two image-header-paragraph columns side-by-side and centred, while allowing the content to adapt to screen size and become one long column on a smaller screen, posed multiple problems. However, by consulting documentation, Google, and ChatGPT, I was able to develop something I am very happy with.

Throughout this project, I learned a great deal. I am now able to build a website, beginning to end. I can style elements using CSS and alter them in JavaScript. As my experience grows, I will only feel more comfortable and be able to do more. I also learned more about the design process. I used sketches for early design and planning, which helped me stay more organized and persevere when I encountered challenges. When I could not solve these challenges on my own, I felt comfortable seeking support through various online resources.

I have gained and strengthened many skills over the course of this project, and I am excited to continue my web development journey.
