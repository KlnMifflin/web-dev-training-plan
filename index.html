            <h3>Mahjong AI Engine</h3>
            <p>After playing mahjong with my friends, I wondered how often I was making the best decision. As an avid chess player, 
                I am well aware of how powerful AI engines are and how greatly they have impacted the game. After exploring how AI 
                programs such as Stockfish and AlphaZero analyze positions, I developed an AI for mahjong in C++ which uses Proximal 
                Policy Optimization to self-learn and determine the best decision given the game state.

            <h3>LLM Training</h3>
            <p>To further my understanding of large language models (LLMs) and explore my interest in the AI sphere, I joined the Data 
                Annotation team, assisting in LLM training. Comparing results from various models, confirming accurate data and safe 
                responses, and ensuring working code outputs are a few of various daily tasks. Alongside this work, I delved into learning 
                how LLMs are built and function, widening my understanding and satisfying my curiousity.
